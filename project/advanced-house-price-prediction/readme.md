Create a complete machine learning project titled "Project-1: Advanced House Price Prediction using Regression Algorithms".

### Project Description:
This project aims to build a robust regression-based model for predicting house prices. The goal is to leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to ensure accurate and reliable price predictions in the real estate market. The model should help buyers and sellers make informed decisions by providing data-driven insights.

### Requirements:
1. Load and preprocess a suitable housing dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or sklearn).
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
3. Handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
5. Train multiple regression models including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Ridge Regression
   - Lasso Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
6. Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ² score.
7. Compare the performance of the models and select the best one.
8. Provide visualizations for model evaluation and prediction results.
9. Include clean, well-commented code and structured project folders.

### Optional:
- Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.
- Deploy the final model with a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit.

### Output:
- Python code files
- Data processing scripts
- Jupyter notebook (if applicable)
- README with project explanation and setup instructions
