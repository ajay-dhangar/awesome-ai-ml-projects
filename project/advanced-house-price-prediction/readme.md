# 🏠 Project-1: Advanced House Price Prediction using Regression Algorithms

### 📌 Overview

This project uses advanced regression algorithms to accurately predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and other property attributes. It provides a powerful tool for real estate professionals, buyers, and sellers to make informed pricing decisions using data-driven insights.

---

### 🧠 Objective

To develop a machine learning model that can predict the sale price of houses by learning from historical real estate data using multiple regression algorithms.

---

### 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Kaggle – [Ames Housing Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
- **Features**: Lot area, Overall quality, Year built, Garage area, Total rooms, etc.
- **Target**: `SalePrice` – the final house price in dollars

---

### 🧪 Algorithms Used

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (e.g., XGBoost)

---

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
- Residual plots
