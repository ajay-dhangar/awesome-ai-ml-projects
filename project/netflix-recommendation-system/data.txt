Create a complete machine learning project titled "Netflix Movie Recommendation System using Content-Based Filtering".

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a personalized movie recommendation system using content-based filtering techniques. Netflix provides a vast catalog of movies and TV shows, and the goal is to suggest relevant content to users based on their preferences. The model should analyze metadata such as genres, cast, director, keywords, and user viewing history to find similar content.

Requirements:
1. Use a suitable movie dataset (e.g., TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset or Netflix titles dataset from Kaggle).
2. Load and clean the dataset:
   - Handle missing values
   - Extract relevant features: title, genres, overview, cast, director, etc.
3. Perform text preprocessing:
   - Combine features into a single content string
   - Use NLP techniques (e.g., TF-IDF or CountVectorizer) to vectorize text
4. Build a content-based recommendation system using cosine similarity.
5. Implement a recommendation function to return top N similar movies based on user input.
6. Provide an interactive interface using Streamlit (optional).
7. Include visualizations for data understanding and similarity metrics.

Output:
- Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- Clean, modular code
- Functionality to input a movie title and get recommendations
- README with setup and usage instructions
- requirements.txt
