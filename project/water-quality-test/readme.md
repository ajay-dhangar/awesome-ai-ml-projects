# 🚰 Project-2: Water Quality Test using Classification Algorithms

### 📌 Overview

Water quality is essential for both environmental sustainability and human health. This project leverages classification algorithms to evaluate and classify water samples into quality categories (e.g., Safe or Unsafe), offering a data-driven approach to water safety analysis.

---

### 🧠 Objective

To build a machine learning model that classifies water samples based on various chemical and physical properties using supervised classification algorithms.

---

### 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle (e.g., "Water Quality" dataset)
- **Features**: pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, etc.
- **Target**: Water quality classification (binary or multi-class)

---

### 🧪 Algorithms Used

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

---

### 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curve & AUC Score
