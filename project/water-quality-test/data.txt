Create a complete machine learning project titled "Project-2: Water Quality Test using Classification Algorithms".

Project Description:
This project aims to classify water samples based on their quality using machine learning classification algorithms. Water quality is crucial for public health, and this model provides a fast, reliable method to assess it.

Project Requirements:
1. Use a suitable water quality dataset (e.g., from UCI Machine Learning Repository or Kaggle).
2. Load and preprocess the dataset:
   - Handle missing values
   - Normalize or scale the features
   - Encode target labels if necessary

3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including:
   - Visualizing feature distributions
   - Correlation matrix
   - Class distribution

4. Train and evaluate multiple classification algorithms:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Decision Tree
   - Random Forest
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost)

5. Evaluate models using classification metrics:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - ROC-AUC (if applicable)

6. Compare model performance and select the best one.

7. Optional: Deploy the best model using a web app (Flask or Streamlit).

Output:
- Clean Python code and Jupyter notebook
- Visualizations of results
- A README file with setup instructions
- requirements.txt file
